Rootkit detection techniques used by the OSSEC HIDS
by Daniel B. Cid, daniel.cid@gmail.com


Starting on version 1.0, the OSSEC HIDS will perform
rootkit detection on every system where the agent is
installed. The rootcheck (rootkit detection engine) will
be executed every X minutes (user specified --by default
every 2 hours) to detect any possible rootkit installed.
Used witht the log analysis and the integrity checking
engine, it will become a very powerful monitoring solution
(the OSSEC HIDS performs log analysis and integrity
checking since version 0.1).

Other feature included on version 1.0 is that the analysis
server will automatically forward the rootkit detection
signatures to the agents, reducing the administration
overhead for the system admin. The agents and server will
keep contact every 10 minutes and if the server is
updated with a new signature file, it will forward them
to all configured agents. Take a look at the management
documentation for more information.

The rootcheck will perform the following steps on the
system trying to find rootkits:


1- Read the rootkit_files.txt which contains a big database
   of rootkits and files used by them. It will try to stats,
   fopen and opendir each specified file. We use all these
   system calls, because some kernel-level rootkits, hide
   files from some system calls. The more system calls we
   try, the better the detection. This method is more like
   an anti-virus rule that needs to be updated constantly.
   The chances of false-positives are small, but false
   negatives can be produced by modifying the rootkits.

2- Read the rootkit_trojans.txt which contains a database
   of signatures of files trojaned by rootkits. This
   technique of modifying binaries with trojaned versions
   was commonly used by most of the popular rootkits 
   available. This detection method will not find any
   kernel level rootkit or any unknown rootkit.
