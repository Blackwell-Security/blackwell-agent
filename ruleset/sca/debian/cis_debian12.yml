    description: "The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems (similar to cramfs ). A squashfs image can be used without having to first decompress the image."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: "Disabling squashfs will prevent the use of snap. Snap is a package manager for Linux for installing Snap packages. 'Snap' application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ('App store'), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well."

  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Automated)
  - id: 29500
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. Notes: - If an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in the tmp.mount file. - tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in /etc/fstab or on the Options line in the tmp.mount file. If we don't specify the size, it will be half the RAM. Resize tmpfs examples: - /etc/fstab tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,nosuid,size=2G 0 0 - tmp.mount [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,size=2G,noexec,nodev,nosuid."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 OR Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: Run the following command to create the tmp.mount file is the correct location: # cp -v /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/ Edit /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon with the unpdated tmp.mount unit file: # systemctl daemon-reload Run the following command to enable and start tmp.mount # systemctl --now enable tmp.mount."

  # 1.1.22 Disable Automounting (Automated)

    title: "Disable Automounting."
    description: "autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives. Note: This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical media in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information being introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual mounting may not increase security."
    rationale: "With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves."
    impact: "The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting."
    remediation: "Run one of the following commands: Run the following command to disable autofs : # systemctl --now disable autofs OR Run the following command to remove autofs # apt purge autofs."

  # 1.1.23 Disable USB Storage (Automated)
  - id: 29500
    title: "Disable USB Storage."
    description: "USB storage provides a means to transfer and store files insuring persistence and availability of the files independent of network connection status. Its popularity and utility has led to USB-based malware being a simple and common means for network infiltration and a first step to establishing a persistent threat within a networked environment. Note: An alternative solution to disabling the usb-storage module may be found in USBGuard. Use of USBGuard and construction of USB device policies should be done in alignment with site policy."
    rationale: "Restricting USB access on the system will decrease the physical attack surface for a device and diminish the possible vectors to introduce malware."
    remediation: "Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf Example: vi /etc/modprobe.d/usb_storage.conf and add the following line: install usb-storage /bin/true Run the following command to unload the usb-storage module: rmmod usb-storage."
