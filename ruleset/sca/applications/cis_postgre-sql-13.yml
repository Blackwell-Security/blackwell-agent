      Irrespective of package source, PostgreSQL services can be identified because it typically
      includes the text string "postgresql". PGDG installs do not automatically register the service
      as a "want" of the default systemd target. Multiple instances of PostgreSQL services often
      distinguish themselves using a version number.

    title: Ensure the log destinations are set correctly
    description: >
      PostgreSQL supports several methods for logging server messages, including stderr,
      csvlog and syslog. On Windows, eventlog is also supported. One or more of these
      destinations should be set for server log output.

    description: >
      The logging collector is a background process that captures log messages sent to stderr
      and redirects them into log files. The logging_collector setting must be enabled in order
      for this process to run. It can only be set at server start.
    rationale: >
      "The logging collector approach is often more useful than logging to syslog, since some
      types of messages might not appear in syslog output. One common example is dynamiclinker failure message; another may be error messages produced by scripts such as
      archive_command.
      Note: This setting must be enabled when log_destination is either stderr or csvlog and
      for certain other logging parameters to take effect."

      The log_directory setting specifies the destination directory for log files when
      log_destination is stderr or csvlog. It can be specified as relative to the cluster data
      directory ($PGDATA) or as an absolute path. log_directory should be set according to your
      organization's logging policy.
    rationale: >
      If log_directory is not set, it is interpreted as the absolute path '/' and PostgreSQL will
      attempt to write its logs there (and typically fail due to a lack of permissions to that
      directory). This parameter should be set to direct the logs into the appropriate directory
      location as defined by your organization's logging policy.

# 3.1.5 Ensure the filename pattern for log files is set correctly (Automated)
  - id: 24005
    title: Ensure the filename pattern for log files is set correctly
    description: >
      The log_filename setting specifies the filename pattern for log files. The value for
      log_filename should match your organization's logging policy.
      The value is treated as a strftime pattern, so %-escapes can be used to specify timevarying filenames. The supported %-escapes are similar to those listed in the Open Group's
      strftime specification. If you specify a filename without escapes, you should plan to use a
      log rotation utility to avoid eventually filling the partition that contains log_directory. If
      there are any time-zone-dependent %-escapes, the computation is done in the zone
      specified by log_timezone. Also, the system's strftime is not used directly, so platformspecific (nonstandard) extensions do not work.
      If CSV-format output is enabled in log_destination, .csv will be appended to the log
      filename. (If log_filename ends in .log, the suffix is replaced instead.)
    rationale: >
      If log_filename is not set, then the value of log_directory is appended to an empty string
      try to write to a directory instead of a file.

# 3.1.6 Ensure the log file permissions are set correctly (Automated)
  - id: 24006
    title: Ensure the log file permissions are set correctly
    description: >
      The log_file_mode setting determines the file permissions for log files when
      logging_collector is enabled. The parameter value is expected to be a numeric mode
      specification in the form accepted by the chmod and umask system calls. (To use the
      customary octal format, the number must start with a 0 (zero).)
      The permissions should be set to allow only the necessary access to authorized personnel.
      In most cases the best setting is 0600, so that only the server owner can read or write the
      log files. The other commonly useful setting is 0640, allowing members of the owner's
      group to read the files, although to make use of that, you will need to alter the
      log_directory setting to store the log files outside the cluster data directory.

      inadvertently expose sensitive data to unauthorized personnel.

# 3.1.7 Ensure 'log_truncate_on_rotation' is enabled (Automated)
  - id: 24007
    title: Ensure 'log_truncate_on_rotation' is enabled
    description: >
      "Enabling the log_truncate_on_rotation setting when logging_collector is enabled
      causes PostgreSQL to truncate (overwrite) existing log files with the same name during log
      rotation instead of appending to them. For example, using this setting in combination with
      a log_filename setting value like postgresql-%H.log would result in generating 24 hourly
      log files and then cyclically overwriting them:

      postgresql-00.log

      postgresql-01.log

      [...]

      postgresql-23.log

      Note: Truncation will occur only when a new file is being opened due to time-based
      rotation, not during server startup or size-based rotation (see later in this benchmark for
      size-based rotation details)."
    rationale: >
      If this setting is disabled, pre-existing log files will be appended to if log_filename is
      configured in such a way that static names are generated.
      Enabling or disabling the truncation should only be decided when also considering the
      value of log_filename and log_rotation_age/log_rotation_size.

# 3.1.8 Ensure the maximum log file lifetime is set correctly (Automated)
  - id: 24008
    title: Ensure the maximum log file lifetime is set correctly
    description: >
      When logging_collector is enabled, the log_rotation_age parameter determines the
      maximum lifetime of an individual log file (depending on the value of log_filename). After
      this many minutes have elapsed, a new log file will be created via automatic log file
      rotation. Current best practices advise log rotation at least daily, but your organization's
      logging policy should dictate your rotation schedule.
